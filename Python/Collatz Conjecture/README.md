# Collatz Conjecture

The [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is a conjecture in mathematics that describes a sequence of numbers defined as follows:

1. Start with any positive integer *n*
2. If *n* is even, the next term is *n/2*
3. If *n* is odd, the next term is *3n+1*

The conjecture is that regardless of the value of *n*, the sequence will always reach 1.


The code in this folder represents multiple attempts to code an algorithm to count the number of steps until *n* reaches 1 in the fewest lines.
The requirements are that it must print very value of *n* as well as the number of steps required to reach 1.
