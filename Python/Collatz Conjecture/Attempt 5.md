[Attempt 5](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_sXgqHn4FvQ_6.py)

This iteration changes the structure once again, removing the function and using a while loop instead.
It was noted that the previous attempt only called the function once, so removing the function saved one line in calling the function.

Lines: 6

No further attempts were made.
