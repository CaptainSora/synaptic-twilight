;; ==== Question 20 ========================


;; (factorial nat) produces the factorial of a nat.
;; factorial: Nat -> Nat

(define (factorial nat)
  (foldr * 1 (build-list nat add1)))


;; (digit-sum nat) produces the sum of the digits of a nat.
;; digit-sum: Nat -> Nat

(define (digit-sum nat)
  (foldr + 0 (map string->number (explode (number->string nat)))))


(digit-sum (factorial 100))
